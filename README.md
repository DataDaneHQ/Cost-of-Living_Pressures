## **Welcome!**

The goal of this project is to evaluate the impact of cost-of-living pressures on residential electricity customers in Victoria. By leveraging compliance and performance data reported by energy retailers, this analysis uncovers trends in arrears, disconnections, and financial assistance uptake, providing a clearer picture of consumer financial distress.

This repository highlights the practical application of data analytics in policy decision-making, demonstrating expertise in data wrangling, visualization, and stakeholder-focused reporting. The insights gained help energy regulators, policymakers, and service providers make informed decisions to enhance consumer protections, refine financial assistance programs, and proactively address affordability challenges.
